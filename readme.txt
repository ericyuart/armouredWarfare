WELCOME TO ARMOURED WARFARE!
This is a one vs. one tank battle to the death.  Traverse the terrain in order
to take down your enemy!

WHAT DO YOU NEED?
Just Python and Pygame (go to the Pygame website to download it if
necessary)!  Be sure to run the game in the Armoured Warfare
folder, however, as the folder contains all of the files necessary to run
the game, from pictures to music.
