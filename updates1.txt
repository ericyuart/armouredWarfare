Updates 1

Updates in the Project Proposal:

Taking into account the amount of time I have left, I have decided to add some
new features (some depending on how much time I have) while taking out some old
ones by either making them optional dependent on time or removing them
completely:

    1.  Took out the round timer.  Now there is no time limit per level.
        You can only win a round if you destroy the enemy.

    2.  The in-game shop will most likely be cut, and even if added, will be
        severely reduced in what you can buy.

    3.  The enemy's health will be placed in the top right corner.  Now you
        will be able to keep track of how much damage they took.

    4.  The game will be able to keep track of total victories.  Both your score
        and the enemy's score will be displayed at the top center of the screen.

    5.  You will not be able to restart a level if you lose.  That match will
        count as a victory for the enemy.

    6.  Depending on how much time I have left, field items which can be picked
        up and used might be added.  These could perhaps add ammunition or maybe
        speed to the lucky tank.

    7.  Secondary weapons will most likely be taken out.

    8.  To prevent people from moving out of the field, I will institute a
        minefield so that if the player moves out of bounds they will be warned
        to go back (if they stay out too long, they wil die!).

    9.  Multiple enemies will most likely be cut unless I have more time.
